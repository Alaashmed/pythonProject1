Welcome to my project on GitHub!

## About
This project was created as part of my learning journey in python.
It is a student management system designed to keep track of students and their enrolled courses. It involves three classes: Main, Course and Student.
The system allows users to add new students, remove existing students, edit student details, display all students, create new courses, and add courses to students' course lists. It ensures that students are enrolled in appropriate courses based on their class levels and provides user-friendly prompts for input validation. Overall, this project aims to facilitate effective management of student records and their course enrollments.

## Feedback
